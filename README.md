# virtualenv-manager

(This is still a work in progress but should have something usable in the next few days.)

After using so many virtural environments for all my python projects lately I've gotten tired of having to open a new terminal window and typing in the virtualenv everytime. So I decided to create a little application to manage all my virtual environments that lets me open a terminal and starts the environment for me.
